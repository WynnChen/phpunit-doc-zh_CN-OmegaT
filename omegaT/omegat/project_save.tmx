        <seg>An annotation is a special form of syntactic metadata that can be added to the source code of some programming languages. While PHP has no dedicated language feature for annotating source code, the usage of tags such as &lt;l0&gt;@annotation arguments&lt;/l0&gt; in documentation block has been established in the PHP community to annotate source code. In PHP documentation blocks are reflective: they can be accessed through the Reflection API's &lt;l1&gt;getDocComment()&lt;/l1&gt; method on the function, class, method, and attribute level. Applications such as PHPUnit use this information at runtime to configure their behaviour.</seg>
